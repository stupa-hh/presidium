# Usage

## Issues

You can create issues to describe problems you have with the presidium.
This can be used for anything related to the duties of the presidium.

Furthermore you can use this to ask the presidium to do something (basically a "feature" wish). 
The last thing you can do is asking the presidium for information.

## Protocols

The repository will also be used to deposit the raw, edited and approved
versions of the protocols in their non-compiled form. That way you can
comment on the edited protocols before the next plenary session, which
reduces the time to approval.

## Summaries

The summaries will also be available in their LaTeX form.

## Wiki

The wiki will be used to showcase the general roadmap plan of the presidium.
You want to know what the guiding principles of the presidium are? Look there.
