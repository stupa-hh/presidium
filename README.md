# Usage

## Issues

You can create issues to describe problems you have with the presidium.
This can be used for anything related to the formal duties of the presidium.

Furthermore you can use this to ask the presidium to do something. The last
thing you can do is asking the presidium for information.

## Protocols

The repository will also be used to deposit the raw, edited and approved
versions of the protocols in their non-compiled form. That way you can
comment on the edited protocols before the next plenary session, which
reduces the time to approval.

## Summaries

The summaries will also be available in their LaTeX form.
